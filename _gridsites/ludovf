Personal website of Ludovico Fischer. Grid is used on the page dedicated to his book: https://www.ludovf.net/reactbook

On large screens, grid layout extracts a content block and places it on a second column. Since the block originally sits in
the middle of other content, the effect wouldnâ€™t have been totally straighforward by other means.
