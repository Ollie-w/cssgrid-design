While working on the OddBird website redesign, we found a great opportunity to
use CSS Grid based on the design we wanted to achieve. We also have Flexbox
fallbacks in place. Currently, CSS Grid is used on the [case study template](http://oddbird.net/work/coachhub/) and will transition to the whole
site over time.
